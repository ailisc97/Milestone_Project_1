## Griffith Park Leisure Centre Responsive Website

![Website Mock Up]

The Giffith Park Leisure Centre is based on an imaginary sport centre based in Dublin 4. The benefit to this website is that people can check out the two main sports (swimming and basketball) that are in this sport centre.
The client requested to show the muliple different classes in the facility. The client requested to show off the Coaches in the sports centre and to give a little bit of a bio about the different Coaches.
Having the Gallery was a great way to show off the most recent championships with the different teams. The Contact page was a necessity for the website and it was essential for the users who had different questions about the multiple different classes avilable.
